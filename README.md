# Troll
* This project drives no business value, provides any helpful solutions, or provides anything substantial to the community
* This application, however, was created with one of the most noble of intentions
    * ...sibling rivalry
    
# Motivation
* During this COVID19 crisis, my family (alongside many others) changed our communication habits and began weekly video chats
* While normally an excellent cause, and 99% of the time this holds true, my older brother reintroduced the family to the ever infamous _Rick Roll_
    * Being the middle child, I was the main target of his shenanigans
    * They were everywhere 
        * valid Google Hangouts hyperlinks that hid a bit.ly link to the Rick Roll
        * Articles about the state in which I live's responses to the Coronavirus, hiding more bit.ly's
        * Coupons, hiding bit.ly's
        * anything, and everything, you can imagine...
* Now I love my family, and I love my older brother, but as the younger brother and middle child it is my birthright to get him back
